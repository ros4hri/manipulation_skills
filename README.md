## About <a name = "about"></a>

The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive skills interface definition for **Manipulation tasks**. This package specifically implements the **hand-grasp** skill interface, allowing for flexible control of robotic hands. The interface includes parameters to define which hand should perform the grasping action, with options for *'left'* or *'right'* when two arms are available. If no specific hand is designated, the system defaults to using the available hand.

Additionally, the interface incorporates standard skills for managing results and feedback during the grasping process. Future enhancements may include parameters to control the degree of gripper closure, further refining the manipulation capabilities of the robotic system.
